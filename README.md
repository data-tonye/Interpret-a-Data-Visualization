# Interpret a Data Visualization

# Project Description
This project was aimed at understanding how to draw insights from dashboard. For this project, I used the African malaria dashboard provided by Tableau. The Tableau link: https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/malaria

## Reason for Project
I needed to understand how to read insights to help businesses solve critical problems to remain relevant. This was a start and with time will do more to uncover great insights.

# Technologies used
Tableau

**Findings**:
African countries have a great number of malaria deaths generally. Kenya had a large number but with time these diseases reduced. The Africa's middle belt has more cases of malaria deaths compared with the north and south of Africa. In most cases, the trends show that with time, the number of deaths have reduced apart from some few countries.
